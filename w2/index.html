    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <img src="../img/marzc.jpg" alt="My Test Image">

    <h2>Small introduction</h2>

    <p class="introduction">My name is Marz Capetillo, 27 years old, born in Fresno, CA most of my life. I attended Hamilton K-8, Fresno high for two year, and Bullard High school for the last two years of high school and graduated in 2016.</p>

    <p class="introduction">I work as a Budtender at Embarc dispensary about 2 years in October. Previously I worked in restaurants and warehouses to try to keep food on the table and a roof over my head. It is a pretty easy retail job, but of course we do get our standard retail drama from time to time, but I still enjoy my job all the same. I have met some pretty cool people along the way</p>
<br>
    <p class="studies">I am currently going to Fresno City College for my general education, but it is not a goal to try and transfer to Fresno State. I did tell myself if I ever get the chance to transfer for better studies, then I won't turn down an opportunity. I have always been interested in computers and technology, so I figured why not make a career out of it. I am excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>

    <p class="experience">Originally I went through <i>San Jose Job Corps</i> to complete my Vocational certification for Culinary Arts, because that is all I ever enjoyed doing was cooking up a delicious meal for people, and hopefully be able to have my recipes to be published. After a few years of working as a cook I came to the conclusion that it isn't worth it to open my own restaurant since it seems like where ever I there is some version of a food stand/truck and local own businesses with such unique menus, it makes it difficult to compete with it. That is where I found myself in retail for the time being, telling myself I'll find something better for myself. Which after a year of moving states and trying different retail jobs, I landed myself working for Embarc, which was something I enjoy doing as a hobby any how, a Marijuana dispensary that has been around since 2022. After about a year and half of working for the company, I came to an acceptance that I am in a stable position to try and see if I can go through college, but the question was, "What am I going to major in?" It bugged me for awhile but after looking at my environment and what I use at home, It came to me that I wanted to do stuff with coding and development.</p>

    <p class="hobbies">In my free time I like to play video games, watch anime, and hang out with friends. I am a pretty big gamer, I have a decent PC that can run most games on high settings, but I do have a PS5 that I use more often than my PC. I also like to watch anime, I have been watching it since I was a kid, and it has always been a big part of my life. I like to hang out with friends that I have over <i>Discord</i>, usually just game with each other and occasionally streaming on 1 of 3 platforms;<i>Twitch</i>,<i>YouTube</i>, or <i>TikTok</i>. I do like to try new things here and there, <strong>Especially</strong> when it comes to trying a restaurant. Even though I don't work in them anymore I still enjoy trying different recipes and creating my own on my free time.</p>
